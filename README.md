# TMCP

Basic simulation of the algorithm Tree-Based Multichannel Protocol (proposed
in the paper "Efficient Multichannel Communications in Wireless Sensor Networks")
run in the simulator [JSensor](https://sites.google.com/site/allalinsufal/home/eletiva-1/20161).

This the part one of the assignment of "Projetos e Aplicações em Redes de Sensores"
(COMP 318, COMP 319 e ECOM 088) at the Universidade Federal de Alagoas.

# Bugs

- At some stage, for still unknown reason, the algorithm fails to allocate channels. Hence some nodes are cut from communications.
